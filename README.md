# ðŸ“… Week 1
## May 13, 2024:
in This day, I immersed myself in the basics of the HTML, gaining a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and javascript. It was exciting to dive into these technologies, each playing a crucial role in web development. I also conducted a preliminary analysis of the project's requirements, identifying front-end. This gave me a clear picture of the scope and direction of our project.
## May 14, 2024:
I spent the day breaking down the project into manageable components, outlining specific functionalities and features for each one. This step was crucial for ensuring a well-organized and systematic approach to development. Additionally, I planned the folder structure to ensure the project remains modular and easy to maintain as it grows. This planning phase felt satisfying, as it laid a strong foundation for the work ahead.
## May 15, 2024:
I began designing the home page component by creating demo for the user interface. This creative process allowed me to visualize the user experience and think critically about design choices and user point of view. I then reviewed and refined the component structure of CSS, adhering to established design principles and best practices to create a front end. This step was both challenging and rewarding for me.
## May 16, 2024:
To facilitate smooth version control and collaboration with team members, I set up a Git repository and a remote GitHub repository. This step was essential for tracking changes and coordinating our efforts effectively. I also initialized the HTML project containing CSS for the front end, setting up all necessary dependencies and configurations. It felt great to see the first pieces of the project coming together.
## May 17, 2024:
I continued to work on the home page design, integrating feedback to improve the visual appeal. This involved a series of small adjustments that resulted in noticeable enhancements. Additionally, I conducted testing and debugging on the frontend components to guarantee their proper functionality and performance. It was gratifying to witness the components evolve into more refined and dependable elements.
## May 18, 2024:
I concentrated on integrating responsiveness into the design of the homepage, guaranteeing that it would accommodate different screen sizes and devices. This was a critical step in delivering a smooth user experience across various platforms. Furthermore, I worked with my mentor to uphold uniformity in code style, design patterns, and the overall alignment of the project. The close collaboration with my mentor offered valuable perspectives and helped to confirm that we were making progress in the right direction.
#### The past week was incredibly productive, laying a solid groundwork for the project's upcoming growth. Every day presented fresh challenges and chances for learning, resulting in an engaging and rewarding experience.
# ðŸ“… Week 2
## May 20, 2024:
I accomplished the design phase by extending it beyond the initial design for additional pages. This ensured a coherent and user-friendly experience for the platform. They also enriched the navigation bar with critical links and buttons such as user registration and login options.
## May 21, 2024:
Significant progress was made in establishing connection to live port the project. i learn function and control structure of Debugging Tool and techniques.
## May 22, 2024:
I focused on DOM manipulation and learn what exactly is DOM manipulation and it's technique. i also learn DOM manipulation using javascript events and event listener.
## May 23, 2024:
I effectively integrated registration and login features, enabling users to securely establish accounts and utilize the platform. Rigorous testing and adjustments guaranteed the presence of accurate authentication and authorization systems. Additionally, I incorporated a Google Login option for users via javascript to enhance the authentication process for user logins.
## May 24, 2024:
on this day i finally created one interacting web page and introduced to Jquarries and all. finally i deploy the web page on web browser and introduced to version control to github and Git
# ðŸ“… Week-3
## May 27, 2024:
I intensified their focus on frontend development, particularly the Internship and Job components. They emphasized user experience and functionality, exploring advanced concepts of React components and hooks to elevate the frontend capabilities.
## May 28, 2024:
Backend development involves creating the server-side logic and databases that power websites and applications. It handles user authentication, database interactions, and server requests. Common server-side programming languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js, each offering unique strengths in scalability, performance, and ease of use for different applications. These languages enable developers to build robust, dynamic backend systems that support the functionality and responsiveness users expect from modern web applications.
## May 29, 2024:
My focus was on thorough testing and debugging of the Internship and Job components, resolving any issues related to performance or display. Additionally, I explored effective strategies for managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript components to enhance data flow efficiency.
## May 30, 2024:
The project's frontend architecture underwent a thorough review to guarantee modularity, reusability, and adherence to coding standards. We delved into methods for improving the rendering performance of CSS components in order to boost the overall responsiveness of the application.
## May 31, 2024:
I worked closely to smoothly incorporate newly developed components into the current project structure. The project was carefully reviewed to pinpoint areas for improvement and scalability in order to boost the project's effectiveness.
