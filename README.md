## May 13, 2024:
in This day, I immersed myself in the basics of the HTML, gaining a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and javascript. It was exciting to dive into these technologies, each playing a crucial role in web development. I also conducted a preliminary analysis of the project's requirements, identifying front-end. This gave me a clear picture of the scope and direction of our project.
## May 14, 2024:
I spent the day breaking down the project into manageable components, outlining specific functionalities and features for each one. This step was crucial for ensuring a well-organized and systematic approach to development. Additionally, I planned the folder structure to ensure the project remains modular and easy to maintain as it grows. This planning phase felt satisfying, as it laid a strong foundation for the work ahead.
## May 15, 2024:
I began designing the home page component by creating demo for the user interface. This creative process allowed me to visualize the user experience and think critically about design choices and user point of view. I then reviewed and refined the component structure of CSS, adhering to established design principles and best practices to create a front end. This step was both challenging and rewarding for me.
## May 16, 2024:
To facilitate smooth version control and collaboration with team members, I set up a Git repository and a remote GitHub repository. This step was essential for tracking changes and coordinating our efforts effectively. I also initialized the HTML project containing CSS for the front end, setting up all necessary dependencies and configurations. It felt great to see the first pieces of the project coming together.
