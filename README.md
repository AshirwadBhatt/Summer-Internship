Summer Internship 
Welcome to my GitHub repository of my 6-week Summer Internship 2024, during 4th semester summer breaks. During this internship, I worked on a project titled "E commerce Website" under my external guide of company CAHOOT TECHNOLOGIES PVT. LTD.

# ðŸ“… Week 1
in This Week, I immersed myself in the basics of the HTML, gaining a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and javascript. It was exciting to dive into these technologies, each playing a crucial role in web development. I also conducted a preliminary analysis of the project's requirements, identifying front-end. This gave me a clear picture of the scope and direction of our project.
I spent the day breaking down the project into manageable components, outlining specific functionalities and features for each one. This step was crucial for ensuring a well-organized and systematic approach to development. Additionally, I planned the folder structure to ensure the project remains modular and easy to maintain as it grows. This planning phase felt satisfying, as it laid a strong foundation for the work ahead.
I began designing the home page component by creating demo for the user interface. This creative process allowed me to visualize the user experience and think critically about design choices and user point of view. I then reviewed and refined the component structure of CSS, adhering to established design principles and best practices to create a front end. This step was both challenging and rewarding for me.
