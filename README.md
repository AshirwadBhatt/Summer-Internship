Summer Internship 
Welcome to my GitHub repository of my 6-week Summer Internship 2024, during 4th semester summer breaks. During this internship, I worked on a project titled "E commerce Website" under my external guide of company CAHOOT TECHNOLOGIES PVT. LTD.

# ðŸ“… Week 1
in This Week, I immersed myself in the basics of the HTML, gaining a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and javascript. It was exciting to dive into these technologies, each playing a crucial role in web development. I also conducted a preliminary analysis of the project's requirements, identifying front-end. This gave me a clear picture of the scope and direction of our project.
